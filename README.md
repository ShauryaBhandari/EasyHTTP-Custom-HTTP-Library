# EasyHTTP - A Custom HTTP Library
Custom HTTP library created usnig Ajax and callbacks. This makes use of ES5 (prototypes). This is the older method and is no longer used now.
Fake REST API was used - JSON placeholder, used for testing and prototyping.

I have also implemented the same using ES6 classes through the FETCH API with promises.
